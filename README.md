## news_flash_gtk-build
Run `install.sh` script to install all dependency.\
This `config.rs` is a template of what configuration you need to do when building news_flash_gtk (there should be `config.rs.in`, just rename to `config.rs` and add all values). See releases for debug builds (they're stipped) 

This is only instruction for those who don't want to build it with `ninja`.
